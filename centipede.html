        <p>Centipede grass, often recognized for its excellent low maintenance qualities, is a popular choice in the southeastern United States. It is well-suited for homeowners seeking a durable yet attractive lawn that requires minimal care. Centipede
            grass is known for its tolerance to acidic soil conditions and its slow growth rate, which reduces the need for frequent mowing.</p>

        <p>This grass type thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers sandy, acidic soils. While it is drought-tolerant once established, Centipede grass benefits from occasional watering during prolonged dry spells. Its light green color and coarse
            texture offer a unique aesthetic compared to other lawn grasses. Fertilization requirements are low, but applying a balanced fertilizer in the spring can help maintain its health and color.</p>
