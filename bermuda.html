        <p>Bermuda grass is a fine-textured, warm-season turfgrass that thrives in full sunlight and is known for its durability and resilience. It's a preferred choice for many homeowners, golf course superintendents, and sports field managers due to its ability to withstand heavy use and recover quickly from damage. Bermuda grass establishes rapidly and creates a dense, green lawn that can effectively compete with weeds when properly maintained.</p>
        
        <p>This grass type is drought-tolerant, requiring less water than some other turfgrasses once established. However, for optimal growth and appearance, Bermuda grass does benefit from regular watering, particularly during dry periods. Fertilization should be performed during the growing season with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to promote lush, vigorous growth. Regular mowing to maintain a height of 1 to 1.5 inches will encourage a dense turf and minimize weed competition.</p>
