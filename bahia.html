        <p>Bahia grass, scientifically known as Paspalum notatum, is a tough, resilient turfgrass that has become a popular choice for its low maintenance requirements and good drought resistance. Originating in Brazil, it has adapted well to various climates, particularly flourishing in the warmer regions. Bahia grass is known for its deep root system, which contributes to its drought tolerance and makes it an excellent choice for erosion control on slopes and in areas where other grasses might struggle to thrive.</p>
        
        <p>While Bahia grass does not require as much fertilization as other types of turfgrass, it benefits from occasional applications of a balanced fertilizer to support healthy growth. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, although it can tolerate some shade. Bahia grass produces a coarse-textured, dense turf that can withstand moderate foot traffic, making it suitable for lawns, parks, and roadside verges.</p>
        
        <p>One of the distinctive features of Bahia grass is its ability to produce tall seed heads, which some may find unsightly. Regular mowing will help manage these seed heads and maintain a neat appearance.</p>
