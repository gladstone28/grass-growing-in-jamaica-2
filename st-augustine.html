        <p>St. Augustine grass, known for its dense, blue-green turf, is widely favored in coastal areas for its ability to tolerate salt and shade. This warm-season grass thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in the southern United States, from
            Florida to California. St. Augustine grass spreads quickly and forms a thick, carpet-like lawn that can withstand moderate foot traffic.</p>

        <p>It requires plenty of moisture and prefers fertile, well-drained soils but is adaptable to less ideal conditions. Regular mowing, fertilization, and watering are essential to maintain its lush appearance. St. Augustine grass is susceptible to
            pests like chinch bugs and diseases such as brown patch, so proactive care is necessary to keep the lawn healthy and vibrant.</p>
